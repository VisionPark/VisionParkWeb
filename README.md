## Description
This repository contains the implementation of a web application built using the Django framework, which includes a user management system. The application allows an administrator to create and configure their parking lot. Additionally, it provides parking occupancy information to other users who wish to view it.
The application is designed with a user-friendly interface, allowing administrators to easily set up and manage their parking lots. 

It incorporates a map feature using Leaflet Maps along with OpenStreetMap data, enabling administrators to establish the location of their parking lot on a map.

To facilitate the segmentation of parking spaces, the application utilizes the DrawerJS tool. This tool allows administrators to interactively draw and define the boundaries of individual parking spaces, ensuring accurate occupancy detection.
